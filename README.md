    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are green, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Verdana font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Verdana is a humanist font and it is both easily readable and appropriate.

        -   Imagery is important. The large, header driving school car image is designed to catch the user's attention.
